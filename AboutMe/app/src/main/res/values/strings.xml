        Hi, my name is Saurabh!
        \n\nI love Cricket.
        \n\nI have been fascinated by Test Cricket as far back as I can remember.
        \n\nRahul Dravid has been my favourite batsman for his elegant game and textbook strokeplay.
        \nI got the wonderful opportunity to meet him as a eight year old, when he was at the pinnacle of his career.
        \n\nCricket is an wholesome game, which only keeps "giving".
        \nAmong the numerous ways Cricket has enriched my life, quick calculations is definitely the
        most valuable one.
        \nConstantly calculating the Required Run-Rate, Average, Economy, Strike Rate has in my opinion
        trained a whole generation in mental math better than schools could ever imagine!
        \n\nI will be more than happy to be your personal Cricket Buddy/Analyst/Commentator/Coach.
        \nYou should ask someone else for real Cricket playing tips thoughâ€¦ :)
        \n\n
